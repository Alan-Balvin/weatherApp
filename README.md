 Weather App  
 
A simple weather application built with React.js, Styled Components, and Tailwind CSS.

Features  
- Real-time weather updates using WeatherAPI  
- Dark mode toggle  
- Responsive UI  
- State Management useState & useEffect: React's built-in hooks to manage state and handle side effects, such as fetching weather data when the component loads.
- API Integration, Fetching Data making an API call to WeatherAPI to retrieve real-time weather data for Mazatlán City, which demonstrates the ability to integrate external services.
- Conditional Rendering with Dark Mode button, handling conditional rendering based on the theme (light/dark), showing ability to work with dynamic states and conditional rendering in React.
- Styled Components CSS-in-JS, using styled-components to write CSS inside JavaScript files, which allows for dynamic styling based on props.
- Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS, using Tailwind for responsive layouts and styling, which shows proficient in utility-first CSS frameworks and responsive design techniques.

6. Theming:
Custom Themes: You're implementing theme toggling between light and dark modes, which is a great example of theming with Styled Components, React context, or state.

7. Routing (optional if you plan to add multiple pages):
React Router (if applicable): In case your app grows with different pages (e.g., city search, settings, etc.), you might use React Router for routing.

8. Error Handling:
Error Boundary (if added): Handling API errors or providing fallback UI in case of an error (e.g., network failure or invalid city).

9. Code Splitting:
React Lazy Loading (optional): If your app becomes more complex and you want to optimize performance, you can implement React’s lazy loading and dynamic import to split your code.

10. Version Control:
Git & GitHub: If you are using Git for version control and GitHub for remote storage, this would demonstrate collaboration and tracking changes in the codebase.

11. Build & Deployment:
Vite: You’re using Vite for fast development and bundling, which improves build performance.

Deployment: Deploying your app on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages would be an essential step to showcase your deployment process.

12. Optimization:
Performance: Using performance optimization strategies like lazy loading images (e.g., for weather icons or background images) or memoization of components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Overall Skills & Technologies:
React.js (Frontend Framework): Your app is built with React, which is one of the most popular frontend libraries.

JavaScript (ES6+ features): You're utilizing modern JavaScript features, such as destructuring, arrow functions, and template literals.

Styled Components: For writing CSS in JS and dynamically styling components.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid UI development.

API Integration: Fetching and displaying data from an external API (WeatherAPI).

Version Control with Git: If you're using Git for collaboration and source code management.

Responsive Design: Ensuring your app looks great on various screen sizes, likely using Tailwind's responsive utilities.
